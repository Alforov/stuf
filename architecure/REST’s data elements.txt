DATA ELEMENT   EXAMPLE

 REST is defined by four interface constraints:
identification of resources; manipulation of resources through representations; selfdescriptive
messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application state. 

resourece -   the intended conceptual target of a hypertext reference
resource identifier - URL, URN
representation -  HTML document, JPEG image
representation metadata - media type, last-modified time
resource metadata -source link, alternates, vary
control data - if-modified-since, cache-control

The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any information that can be
named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal service (e.g. “today’s weather
in Los Angeles”), a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and
so on. In other words, any concept that might be the target of an author’s hypertext
reference must fit within the definition of a resource. A resource is a conceptual mapping
to a set of entities, not the entity that corresponds to the mapping at any particular point in
time.
REST uses a resource identifier to identify the particular resource involved in an
interaction between components.
