A software architecture is defined by a configuration of architectural
elements—components, connectors, and data—constrained in their
relationships in order to achieve a desired set of architectural properties



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPONENT
A component is an abstract unit of software instructions and internal
state that provides a transformation of data via its interface.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONNECTOR
A connector is an abstract mechanism that mediates communication,
coordination, or cooperation among components.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA
A datum is an element of information that is transferred from a
component, or received by a component, via a connector
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION
A configuration is the structure of architectural relationships among
components, connectors, and data during a period of system run-time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROPERTIES
The set of architectural properties of a software architecture includes all properties that
derive from the selection and arrangement of components, connectors, and data within the
system. Examples include both the functional properties achieved by the system and nonA
configuration is the structure of architectural relationships among
components, connectors, and data during a period of system run-time.

functional properties, such as relative ease of evolution, reusability of components,
efficiency, and dynamic extensibility, often referred to as quality attributes [9].

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STYLES
An architectural style is a coordinated set of architectural constraints
that restricts the roles/features of architectural elements and the allowed
relationships among those elements within any architecture that
conforms to that style.

Views
An architectural viewpoint is often application-specific and varies widely
based on the application domain. ... we have seen architectural viewpoints that
address a variety of issues, including: temporal issues, state and control
approaches, data representation, transaction life cycle, security safeguards,
and peak demand and graceful degradation. No doubt there are many more
possible viewpoints.
