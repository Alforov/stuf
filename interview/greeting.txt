How to Introduce Yourself at a Job Interview

When you arrive at the interview site introduce yourself to the receptionist by stating your name and the purpose of your visit. For example: "My name is Tim Jones and I have an interview scheduled with John Smith at 2 pm."

Hello, I'm [first name][last name]."
"I'm Tina Lionel, it's a pleasure to meet you."
